 How It Works

* Built using **Next.js 13+** App Router with `"use client"` to enable interactive behavior in React components.
* Widgets are placed absolutely and rendered dynamically with custom dimensions and positions.
* **Edit Mode** toggle allows users to drag and resize widgets using **interact.js**.
* When widgets overlap during movement, they are automatically pushed apart to avoid clutter.
